# 🕳️ Pothole Detection using YOLOv8

This project implements a **Pothole Detection System** using the **YOLOv8 object detection model**.  
The model is trained on a custom pothole dataset and is capable of detecting potholes in road images with bounding boxes.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Train a YOLOv8 model to detect potholes in road images  
- Perform inference on unseen test images  
- Visualize and save detection results  
- Provide a **verifiable Jupyter Notebook** showing executed code and outputs

## 🧠 Model Used

- **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)**
- Pretrained weights: `yolov8n.pt`
- Fine-tuned on a custom pothole dataset
